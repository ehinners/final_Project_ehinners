            The Pyro class is characterized by his ability to disorient and ambush players, with damage over time making in impact even after you've retreated from a fight. While the flamethrower has an incredibly short range, one should take care to not underestimate the utility of the airblast and its ability to protect teammates, hold an objective, deal massive redirected damage, or crowd-control. The lingering flames of this primary weapon make him ideal for exposing invisble spies, or finding out who is friend or foe.
        </p>

            With pyro's limited range, average movement speed, and specialized utility, pyro only finds niche usefulness. Pyro should only be used when holding a position is do or die with your back against the wall, or if you're feeling espeically paranoid about spies. Note that pyro's airblast is especially effective in protecting a friendly engineer's buildings, as the main threat to them are projectiles launched from far away. Pyro's airblast is also ideal for holding objectives, as the blast is one of the few things in the game capable of moving or stunning ubered players, as they are totally invulnerable to all forms of damage. When it comes time to gaining position, or when speed is key, pyro is to be avoided, as well as on maps with large pools of water which will negate half of your damage output. Look for spots in which you can either ambush people coming to you, or drop down from up high to catch people within the range of your flamethrower. A pyro has poor matchups against scouts, heavies, and engineers which will quickly deplete the pyro's health before he gets within effective range. Pyro has favorable matchups against soldiers, as they have difficulty dealing damage without risking their rockets being reflected back at them. Pyro also has favorable matchups against snipers, spies, and medics, as they lack damage output in close quarters.

            There are three common mistakes pyro players make. While your flame particles are the most consistent way of exposing a cloaked or disguised spy, your short range and slow movement speed makes you easily escapable. If you're having issues with spies, a scout is able to chase down and punish players better than anyone else, and scouts are also much harder for spies to fight. The other two common mistakes come from the flamethrower, specifically the airblast. The powerful utility of the airblast is often overlooked by newer players, with some not even knowing it exists. These types of players almost never switch away from their flamethrower, just holding down fire and rushing at the enemy. It is much more effective to sometimes tactically retreat and at least get SOME damage in over range with your secondary items. The last mistake players make, again with airblast, is they attempt to airblast too much, spamming it at every opportunity. The airblast is best used with timing in mind, in conjunction with your secondary for maximum damage output and the most consistent range.

            Pyro's two main roles come from either exposing spies, or reflecting projectiles, as such there are things you can do to practice these. 
            1. Try and learn common walkways and paths spies take, as well as their favorite hiding spots. You can save a lot of time by just checking these key areas with a greater focus. 
            2. Try and learn timings and reactions of enemy players. Reflecting projectiles from far away as easy, as you have plenty of time to see them coming. At point blank range, to reflect a projectile you have to know when your opponent will fire their weapon before they do, and success will only come from prediction and experience.

            Generally, as pyro's main utility comes from his airblast, you probably want to stick with weapon choices that compliment it. Stay away from weapons with slow or expensive airblast such as the phlogistinator, dragon's fury, or backburner. Functionally the stock and degreaser will offer similar utility. As pyro is often a niche pick for dire circumstances, the rest of your weapon choices come down to preference. For secondary weapons, there really is no best or worst here, either acting as a backup midrange weapon, or a spam tool, it is your primary weapon that will be the most feared. In terms of melee weapons, your choice should come down to utility, as if someone is close enough to hit, they're also close enough to ignite with a flamethrower, and doing so is easier too. The powerjack is commonly accepted as THE weapon of choice, as equipping it will give pyro a much needed speed boost, allowing him to close the gap (if just barely) with his short range primary. If you're holding last, or just taking a more supportive role, the homewrecker offers major utility in fighting off spies, and knocking away sappers, although friendly engineers would probably prefer you focus on dealing with threats rather than trying to unsap their buildings.
