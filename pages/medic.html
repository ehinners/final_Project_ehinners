                      <p>When you play medic, who you decide to heal, and how often you heal,  will be the deciding factors if your teammates live or die. Common mistakes including healing players who are not going anywhere near the front lines, as currently fighting players or players who are about to fight need the healing most. Care should be taken to avoid healing too few teammates, or only one player. Make sure to spread the healing around to as many players as possible. Avoid healing players who have max health when there are players near you who have really low health. When you have your uber charge, avoid holding onto it for too long. At some point an enemy medic will get their ubercharge, and you will have lost advantage. Always deploy your charge if you feel threatened, as it is better to have a poor uber than to die without have not deployed it at all. When you heal a teammate, their overheal can sometimes give them great confidence. Make sure when following your heal target, if they overextend, do not follow them. Never feel bad about retreating if you think you are in a poor position. Avoid excessive use of your combat options or ranged healing, as while the short-term gains might seem appealing, it is more important to have long-term gains of building your ubercharge. </p>

                      <p>In the moments before the fighting starts, a medic has a short opportunity to prepare his teammates for battle. When a medic heals a teammate who already has full health, that player will recieve what's known as an "overheal". An overheal will put a player up to 150% health. For example, since a scout's base health is 125, they can be overhealed to 185 health, and since a heavy has 300 base health, they can be overhealed to 450 health. Due to the variation of movement speed amongst classes, and how different classes move, the order of who you heal is vital to making sure EVERYONE gets to the fight fully healed. For a standard competitive roster, the order goes like this: Demoman, Roamer, Scout1, Scout 2, Roamer Again, then finally Pocket. Demoman gets first heals because he will be jumping away and trying to get to the fight first. As he will take a LOT of damage from his sticky jumps, it's important that he have a LOT of health for his approach. Secondly, the roamer will need a lot of health for his first few jumps, but the medic will catch up to him during the rollout. Next, there's a brief opportunity to heal both scouts before they outrun the medic. After they do, the medic will be able to heal the roamer again until he meets up with the pocket right before the fight. While this heal order is important, it is also important to know some of the more subtle mechanics of how healing works. <br> When the medic heals a target, he will heal a target at 24 health per second. However, thanks to a mechanic referred to as "crit healing", if a healing target has not taken any damage for an extended amount of time, they will recieve a 300% boosted healing rate. To improve as medic, it's important to keep track of your teammates and figure out when they can recieve crit healing, or if they will only recieve standard healing. If a teammate is full health, but is available for crit healing, it's worth it to quick give them an overheal. This is utilized to optimize the heal order. Before a demoman or roamer performs their first jumps, it's possible to give them crit healing very quickly to prepare them for their rollout. After that, a quick tag on each scout will give them a crit-heal full overheal. If the pocket does NOT rocket jump during their rollout, and instead reduces their health to very low and use the <a HREF="soldier.html">ESCAPE PLAN</a>'s bonus movement speed to get to middle, and by the time they get there, their crit heal timer will be reset, allowing the medic to quickly catch them up to full health. Conversely, there's another mechanic that can used when a teammate has just taken damage.<br> As the medic heals a target, they will build uber at a rate of 2.5% per second, meaning that the medic will have an uber every 40 seconds. HOWEVER, if a teammate has over 142.5% health, they will build uber at a REDUCED rate (1.25% per second, or a total of 80 seconds). As a medic, it's important to keep healing targets that aren't fully overhealed, and not heal an overhealed target for too long. A medic's teammates can help with this by damaging themself. If a <a HREF="scout.html">scout</a> has 185 health, they can hit themselves with the boston basher to reduce their health below the 142.5%, and help the medic build uber at the maximum rate. Soldiers can also do this by simply firing a rocket at their feet. <br> At a higher level of play, it can be important to predict when the enemy team will deploy their uber, or attack them before they've reached their uber. Typically, it's expected of one medic to keep track of the enemy medic's uber charge. This can be done in a few easy steps. 1. When booting into the game, locate and take a mental note of what the enemy medic's name is. 2. As the game progresses, keep an ear open for teammate's calls as they declare they've killed the enemy medic. Before hearing that call, keep an eye on the killfeed to look for the name that's been noted, or simply check the scoreboard to see if that enemy medic is still alive. 3. Once that medic has died, keep an eye on when they respawn by repeatedly checking the scoreboard and then keep a mental note on what the time clock says. If 40 seconds are added to that time clock directly after the enemy medic respawns, that is when it can be predicted the enemy medic will have uber.</p>

                      <p>Medic actually does not offer a lot of unlockable items to choose from, and if a medic is spending too much time doing anything other than healing, they're doing a great disservice to their team. Each unlockable medigun offers a different kind of ubercharge. It is generally accepted that the other unlocakble types of uber simply do not compare to being invincible, and offer very little utility in return. The default medigun is THE best healing option, with one exception. If a medic finds himself consistently being killed just before they can attain the default medigun, it might be beneficial to switch to the kritzkrieg. The kritzkrieg charges 25% faster, and when deployed, gives the healing target garaunteed critical hits (200% BONUS damage) This can be utilized for extremely aggressive playstyles in which the team using the kritzkrieg can rush in and deploy their charge BEFORE the enemy has built up an uber, and deny them the option by killing their medic. Doing this repeatedly, can catch a team up if they had lost a lot of uber advantage earlier in the game. This strategy isn't foolproof, and just one poor kritzkrieg charge can lose a team all advantage they had gained. This is best reserved for a desperation play, or a surprise play. It is advised to do so sparingly, but occasionally to keep your strategies unpredictable.<br>For primary or melee weapons, the best options serve to only compliment your secondary. Rather than focus on damage output or other utility, the ubersaw can give you a quick free 25% uber if you hit an enemy with it. Compared to all other options, this is irreplacable as the one and only choice for aspiring medics everywhere. Unlike melee weapons, the medic's primary slot options are mostly focused on damage and survivability rather than utility. Keeping this in mind, the crusader's crossbow shines as a pure utility option, allowing a medic to heal his teammates at ranges past the reach of the medigun. Not only does the crossbow have incredible reach, but it has large burst healing almost approaching 100 hp in one shot. A well placed shot can save a teammate from across the map. If used properly, a medic properly applying his crossbow will extend the life of his teammates tenfold. Except no substitute. Care should be taken to only place a crossbow shot if a teammate is standing still for it, or if they are dying at a rate in which the medigun's 24 hp/ second will not save them. Spamming the crossbow, missing too many shots, or using it too much will severely impede progress on building an uber charge.</p>

It is advised to do so sparingly, but occasionally to keep your strategies unpredictable.<br>For primary or melee weapons, the best options serve to only compliment your secondary. Rather than focus on damage output or other utility, the ubersaw can give you a quick free 25% uber if you hit an enemy with it. Compared to all other options, this is irreplacable as the one and only choice for aspiring medics everywhere. Unlike melee weapons, the medic's primary slot options are mostly focused on damage and survivability rather than utility. Keeping this in mind, the crusader's crossbow shines as a pure utility option, allowing a medic to heal his teammates at ranges past the reach of the medigun. Not only does the crossbow have incredible reach, but it has large burst healing almost approaching 100 hp in one shot. A well placed shot can save a teammate from across the map. If used properly, a medic properly applying his crossbow will extend the life of his teammates tenfold. Except no substitute. Care should be taken to only place a crossbow shot if a teammate is standing still for it, or if they are dying at a rate in which the medigun's 24 hp/ second will not save them. Spamming the crossbow, missing too many shots, or using it too much will severely impede progress on building an uber charge.
