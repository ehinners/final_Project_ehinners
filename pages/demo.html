            The Demoman class is characterized by his explosive ordinance, and remote detonation. Demoman can perform an explosive jump, just like soldier, but with the addition of a controled detonation, and greater damage, demoman can often hop along, quickly and efficiently tying together jumps, to any point faster than anyone else albeit at a massive penalty to his health points. Demoman lacks any and all hitscan weapons, meaning that all of his attacks are projectile based, making him the most difficult class to master, but if played correctly has the largest output.
        </p>
        <h3  id="big" id="when">When To Play Demoman?</h3> <div id="pageNav"><a HREF="#overview">Class Overview,</a>When to Play,<a HREF="#avoid"> What to Avoid,</a> <a HREF="#practice"> What to Practice, </a><a HREF="#unlock"> Which weapons to use.</a></div>
        <p id="big" >
            Not only does the demoman have incredibly explosive weaponry, but his sticky bomb launcher can delay an attack for precise timings over a large area, and he can quickly and efficiently explosive jump along rollouts faster than anyone else. A player playing demoman will make or break your team, and is the central force. In high level play, you should only pick this class if you're confident with your weaponry, your fighting ability, your rollouts, and your overall awareness of gamestate and how to approach teamfights and who to focus. This is in no way an intro-level character. In more casual environments, at least one demoman is a must have at all times. A proficient demoman will be a one-man army that seems nigh unstoppable. Care should be taken to avoid picking demoman if too many demomen are on your team, or if you have too many support players. A demoman's explosive attacks deal massive burst damage, but since he lacks any hitscan weaponry, it can be sometimes tricky to clean up the last 5-15 points of damage on your opponent, meaning he plays best with a teammate that can chip away any damage left after your first wave of mortars. Demoman can also be a vital choice if your team is struggling to overcome very large obstacles, such as sentries, or heavy players. The demoman's ability to close the gap quickly with a well timed sticky jump, and his incredibly high damage output gives him favorable matchups against almost every single class. The exception is scouts, in which their ability to dodge vertically and move erratically makes them very difficult to hit with demoman's projectile only weaponry.

            With as powerful as demo is, there is a lot of potential to make mistakes. Avoid trying to deal too much damage at once unless you know there will be significant downtime after a fight, as burning through all your ammo will leave you out of commission when it matters most, as you stick behind and reload. Avoid trying to attack targets too far away, as your projectiles are easy to see coming, and at longer ranges don't even do that much damage, save your ammo. Avoid excessive use of rolling grenades, as a direct hit will do the most damage, as much as 4 or even 5 times as much damage if you aim for center mass rather than the floor. Your grenade launcher will most often be your only option for self defense if you find yourself caught out, away from your team, so make your shots count. Even though you can sticky jump to get to areas faster than anyone else, you should not do so excessively as when you get there your health will be very low, and you're no use to anyone in a great position if you can't hold it. Don't try and go for kills, simply try and do the most possible damage. A sticky bomb or a direct grenade will do 90 to 100 damage, so its a waste to try and land that shot on someone with only 15 health left. Focus on players who have large amounts of health left. Hold back and just try and lay suppressive fire, letting your teammates clean up with small amounts of chip damage, as their hitscan weapons are much more suitable for such.

            Demoman is defined by his projectile weapons, as they are all he has. All aspects of his gameplay will come down to how versed you are with the projectile arcs, timings, and projectile speed.
            1. As demoman, it is your job to get to the mid-point first. It is paramount that you know your rollouts by heart. If you let the enemy demoman beat you to middle, the entire fight is lost.
            2. Study common movement paths, rotation timings, and map geometry. A big advantage your sticky bomb launcher has is that you can detonate your bombs at any time. Time a well hidden trap right, and you can wipe almost an entire enemy team right when they think they are at their most untouchable.
            3. Practice fighting 1 v 1, and practice often. Demoman is very difficult, and even just simple fighting skills need to be sharpened with hundreds of hours of practice. Unlike rockets, which fly in a straight line, or detonate on impact, your weapons arc through the air, following a curved path, and sticky bombs and rolling grenades will not detonate upon contact with a surface, so you will need to know how to use that to your favor, and when to detonate your bombs.
            4. Nothing is more embarrassing than wandering into a fight with no shots loaded, or with no ammo. Since you will be laying down suppressive fire, and carpet damage, you must remain EXTREMELY vigilant with making sure you are always reloading your weaponry, and full to the brim with ammo.
        </p>

        <p id="big" >
            Demoman's power comes almost exclusively from the timing of his sticky bomb launcher, how much damage it does, and how many rounds it can hold. Sacrificing any of these aspects is foolish. Stock sticky bomb launcher is THE best, accept no substitute. The grenade launcher is tried and true, as it's hard to argue with a direct 100 damage, but as the iron-bomber is almost functionally identical for self-defense, a case can be made for making the switch. The pain train can be a highly useful weapon unlock, if you can reach an objective faster than a scout, why not capture faster than him too? The passive ability of this weapon finds its use in niche cases in which you find opportunities to back-cap, for if you've found yourself in a fight with a melee weapon as demoman, you're doing something wrong.
