            The soldier class is characterized by his larger than average health pool, great burst and explosive damage, and being able to propel himself across the map with a well-timed rocket jump. While his rocket launcher is neither precise, nor fast, it packs quite the wallop, and is very useful to spam chokepoints or common areas for free damage with its large splash radius. His large health pool and ability to fly through the air makes him ideal for clearing through chokepoints and initiating pushes, and his rocket launcher excells at dealing consistent long range damage to stationary targets like sentry guns. 
        </p>

            With his ability to close the gap with an expertly performed rocket jump, and powerful blast weaponry, soldier is an THE round-about flexible class. He can come from unexpected angles in the air, raining down hell or deal massive damage up close, to protect his allies. He excells in quickly attacking vertical positions, and if he can attain them, gains a massive advantage in shooting his rocket launcher down at the foes below. It's pretty important that your team have one or two soldiers at all times, but with all classes, it's important to not have too many, although if there was one class to have the most of, it's definitely soldier. Note that soldier's only source of fast movement or verticality comes at a price of taking a sizable hit to his health pool per rocket jump. If you're too low health, you won't be able to use this to escape, and if you abuse it too much to gain position, you won't have the staying power to keep it. It's important to know where your medic is, and stick by as well as protect him to make sure you get the most out of your rocket jumping abilities. A soldier's rocket launcher gives him favorable matchups against any class, although care should be taken when fighting pyros, as a properly timed reflect will save the pyro's life, and deal massive damage back to the soldier.

            There are two common mistakes soldier players make. While your rocket jumping allows you to fly through the map at great speed, encroaching onto enemy territory makes you a very large target, and if you're alone you will almost instantly be put down. Care should be taken to coordinate with your team, and only jump in when the enemy is either distracted by your team, or when your team can capitalize on you being a distraction. When fighting another player, it might be tempting to unload your rocket launcher in one go, but as its slow to load, and only holds FOUR shots, care should be taken to be patient with your fire and hold until you are SURE that your shot will connect. Care should also be taken to make sure you don't completely empty out, as if someone ambushes you, you will want at LEAST one emergency shot to use during the confrontation.

            As mentioned SEVERAL times, soldier's utility comes down to how well a player can rocket jump, as when he doesn't utilize this ability, he's just too slow compared to the rest of your team. There are plenty of tutorials available to help you learn how to perform simple rocket jumps, but there are certain things you can do to make your jumping even better.
            1. Learn several types of jumping. Speed pogos, wall jumps, speed shots, wall pogos, syncs, water jumps, or more. The more varations on your rocket jump you know how to perform, the more creatively you can string them together, being a more unpredictable, and therefore dangerous, player.
            2. Practice your rollouts. Not only should you learn styles and practice them on jump maps, but you should specifically paths from point a to b on each map. Know how to get from spawn to mid at the same time as your team. Know how to race from a forward spawn to each point. Know how to not only reach certain areas, but positions as well. Practice these rollouts trying to optimize how much health you have when you get there, and how to do it without taking too much fall damage. 
            3. Practice fighting with the rocket launcher. Unlike hitscan weapons like shotguns or pistols, the rocket launcher will not deal damage to someone just because your cursor is on them. Rockets have travel time, and you will need to lead your shots, and predict enemy movement. There's no easy, or quick way to do this, it all comes with experience. Study enemy behaviour, and get comfortable with the distance of the splash radius, the speed of your rockets, and how fast you can shoot, reload, or switch weapons.
            4. Care should be taken to not be over-confident with your rocket jumping. Scouts are very good at denying you, so take a moment to survey the area before you jump in. If you see a scout holding the high ground, you're gonna have a rough time trying to take it from him. Hold off and try and usher him away with spam or chip shots before you take the leap.
            Scout's core gameplay loop comes down to a simple premise, jump and shoot, but to do so better than everyone else, there are key things to focus on to improve your gameplay.

           Of all the unlockable weapons in the game, soldier has the most, 9 different launchers, 3 different shotguns, 3 different banners, 3 different wearables, and a lazer gun, and that's not even getting into the melee items. Overall, soldier's utility comes down to how well he can rocket jump, and how well he can utilize the high ground. In more competitive scenarios, it is not advised to use weapons such as the direct hit or air strike that can't deny areas, and it's not advised to use the beggar's bazooka due to its lack of accuracy at longer range. If you want to stay near your medic, and focus on protecting him, you will probably not find a greater use than the stock rocket launcher or the cow mangler (functionally the same as stock, or the original) as not only do they have great damage output, but sustainability in its magazine size. If you choose to play more loosely, trying to get behind the enemy team and distract them, you might find success with the black box or the liberty launcher, as the reduced health on rocket jump, or the health gain on hit will let you keep rocket jumping when other soldiers might have to retreat to a medic, or grab a health pack. Of the available secondaries, soldier can use almost all of them in a competitive setting. As your primary damage source will be from your rocket launcher, any of the 3 shotguns available to you will do the job just about the same. Each of the 3 banners can be used effectively, given your team knows how to coordinate with you (think of it as a different type of uber charge) Other than these, the other secondaries are not reccomended with the shining exception being the gunboats. For the same reason the liberty launcher excells in letting you play a more roaming style, the gunboats let you fly around the map with much less reliance on healing or packs, and these in conjunction with the liberty launcher or black box increases your roaming ability exponentially. When roaming, you don't have to have a great damage output to be effective. You only need to be in the right place at the right time to take out one important target. Sometimes damage isn't needed at all, so long as the entire team is distracted at looking at you, or searching for you behind enemy lines, this will give your teammates a great opportunity to push in and secure the objective. While the soldier has plenty of melee options available to him, and each is fun in their own right, a competitive focus should be put on just two: the Discplinary action, and the escape plan. Securing positioning is paramount to victory, and these two melee weapons that either increase the movement speed of you, or your teammates let you do just that. Accept no substitute, even stock can't compare. Generally the escape plan is accepted as being the better option, as you can operate it with greater independance, for formats with larger amounts of players such as RGL league, or highlander, the disciplinary action can make slower classes such as the heavy much more effective. To read more on why you should use the escape plan to get to mid, head on over to the <a HREF= "medic.html">medic</a> page to understand how crit heals can make the escape plan your medic's best friend in quick and effective healing OR uber building.
