        <h2>New To TF2?</h2>
        
        <p>Here are some tips for your first experience. The first thing you'll want to do is make sure you're comfortable controlling your character. Now there's not much you can do to change how your weapons act, or how you move, but the main thing to focus on is your aim, then some settings in game you can alter, and some general things to keep in mind when playing, no matter what class.</p>
        
        <h3>Aim</h3>
        
        <p>
            There are three main things to keep in mind when you aim. 1. No matter how much you tinker with your sensitivity, you wanna make sure that your aim is consistent enough to improve with it. This means having a muscle memory to improve upon. You gotta make sure that you go into windows settings, and disable mouse acceleration. Mouse acceleration means that where your mouse moves depends on how fast you move it, not how far. Generally, for getting consistent results, that's a bad thing. 2. You want your aim to be under control. If your sensitivity is set too high, you won't be able to hit when it counts. TF2 is full of weapons that are very hit or miss.  A scattergun can either do 100 damage or 5, so it is painstakingly important to have precise movement when controlling your mouse. The lower your sensitivity, the more control you will have. 3. You want to be aware of your surroundings. Since spies can be anywhere, you want to be able to keep your head on a swivel and always watch your back. The higher your sensitivity, the more easily you can be aware of your surroundings. To find a balance between these two, you can do a simple test. While moving around in game, find a single target to focus on, the smaller the better. Look directly behind you, and try to flip your aim around in a direct 180. If you need to move your mouse too much to do so, your sensitivity is too low. Increase your sensitivity a little by little until you can flip around 180 easily, but not too easily. Next, focus on that target again and Circle around it, and try and focus on it. If you're having trouble keeping focus, try decreasing your sensitivity little by little until it feels natural. Bounce between these two steps, increasing and decreasing until you find a nice middle ground.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Settings</h3>
        
        <p>
            Once you get into the game, there are a couple things you can do to help you fight. One, while fighting you need to keep a focus on your crosshair to make sure your aim is true. Customizing the size, shape, and color of your crosshair can help with that. You can do that in the multiplayer settings. Two, after you deal damage, you'll want to make sure you know how many shots you need to hit, and which gun to use. By changing the color of your damage numbers, you can more easily see how much damage you've done. Seeing how much damage you've done is important. For example, if you hit a scout with a good hit, you might need to only hit them again. If it said you hit them for 100, you might only need to tap them with the pistol to finish them off, but if you only did 60 damage, you probably wanna go for another full scatter shot. You can make sure your damage numbers are a nice visible color in the advanced settings.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Mindset</h3>
        
        <p>
            Team Fortress 2 isn't like shooters you've played before, here are some things to keep in mind as you play. As you play the game, there might be players that look like your teammates, but are actually enemies. Spies have the ability to disguise as your teammates. You can figure out if they're really your teammates or not in a couple ways. One you can just shoot your teammates every once and a while, or give 'em a smack with your melee weapon. The other tell tale sign you got a spy is if you can't move through them. Teammates will never impede your movement, but enemies will. <br>
            Basic arena shooter tactics include always moving, if you stay still you're dead. Against snipers, they'll only really get you if they hit your head, so make sure to duck and weave. Each TF2 map will have various pickups like health and ammo. It's important to always keep your health full, your gun loaded, and deny your enemy the chance to pick up health packs in one on one fights. <br><br>
            A special notice: In case you haven't read the other class-specific pages, know that going into the game you don't have to spend any money. You might feel pressured to spend your real life dollars, or sell the things in your backpack to get any of the unlockable items that TF2 has to offer, but know that the game at its core is balanced, and paying extra money won't help you win. The stock items, the default items that you start the game with, that came with the game back in 2007, THOSE are considered the best, and most consistent weapons available. Those default weapons are what professionals use to win world-wide tournaments, and those are the weapons have never recieved a nerf, have never been unpopular, and have never been inconsistent.
