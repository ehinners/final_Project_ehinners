            The Sniper class is characterized by his slow weaponry, but incredibly high damage per shot at incredibly long range. This makes him ideal for picking off high value targets before they even reach the fight. Conversely, sniper suffers and finds challenge in close range engagements, as its difficult to find an enemy within the incredibly focused tunnel vision a scope provides. Sniper's secondary weaponry, the smg, can finish off a low health target if his aim is true, but on even footing, sniper will lose close range engagements almost every time.
        </p>

            With his incredibly slow firing rate, and precise weaponry, this makes sniper a difficult class to play for players with little to no experience. Generally, it is more helpful to a team to have consistent, yet inaccurate damage spammed via rockets or sticky bombs, but if a player is confident in their ability to secure shots within small windows of opportunity, sniper has the potential to have the highest damage output in the game, which simply cannot be ignored. Due to the nature of his long range rifle, snipers will not find themselves in the middle of a fight, meaning teammates will find themselves a little more focused on during firefights, as there are simply less bodies for the enemies to be distracted by. Sniper should only be picked if, again, a player is confident with their skill, and if no one else is playing sniper. It doesn't matter how well a sniper player is, as a lack of presence in large fights will not impede enemy advancement, resulting in quick and devestating losses of each objective. For every sniper, there must be several players standing between him and the enemy, as a sniper's close range utility is very low. Sniper will find the most success on slower maps in which he has a large time frame to attack enemies before they reach him, and has strong matchups against heavies who have a hard time dodging his precision shots. Snipers have a poor matchup against scouts, which can dodge his shots easily, both horizontally and vertically, in addition to their speed which will close the gap VERY quickly.

            If playing sniper is the right choice, there's a couple things to avoid doing while sniping. Avoid charging shots for too long. Sitting and waiting for the perfect shot will often reduce your usefulness compared to if you went for a riskier shot, and maybe only did a small amount of damage, but when chipping away at enemies, every point of damage matters. It's more important to deal damage more often, rather than infrequent moments of large damage. It is sometimes drilled into player's minds that the medic is the most important class to kill, and that he should be a primary target at all times. While killing the medic IS highly important, almost any class has a favorable matchup to do so. Sometimes it's more important to kill the player PROTECTING the medic. A player should have a solid reason to focus an enemy medic besides them simply having the shot. A critical headshot does so much damage compared to the small fire from other classes, so that when a class is fighting against a player being healed by a medic, their damage might not overcome the heal-rate that the enemy provides. In those circumstances, a sniper's large burst damage can kill a class in one shot, overcoming medics healing abilities entirely, making him suited to focusing on the players being healed, rather than the medic himself.
        </p>
        <h3  id="big" id="practice">What to practice?</h3> <div id="pageNav"><a HREF="#overview">Class Overview,</a><a HREF="#when"> When to Play,</a><a HREF="#avoid"> What to Avoid,</a>  What to Practice, <a HREF="#unlock"> Which weapons to use.</a></div>
        <p id="big" >
            Sniper's precision based gameplay means that all there is between him and success is a well placed shot. If you miss, you've done nothing, if you hit your shots, you've done a LOT. Practice comes down to simply getting comfortable with your sniper rifle, and getting comfortable with your sensitivy/ aiming style. It's important to keep in mind, that sniper is the only class that cares about the position of the head hitbox, so a competant sniper player should know where it is. When a spy disguises, they merely change their appearance, not their hitbox. When attempting to line up a shot against what a player thinks is a disguised spy, the sniper should aim for where they think the spy's head is, not where the disguise says his head is.
        </p>
        <h3  id="big" id="unlock">Which weapons to use?</h3> <div id="pageNav"><a HREF="#overview">Class Overview,</a><a HREF="#when"> When to Play,</a><a HREF="#avoid"> What to Avoid,</a> <a HREF="#practice"> What to Practice, </a> Which weapons to use.</div>
        <p id="big" >
            Playing sniper is an incredibly personal, and emotional experience. Every shot is the difference between complete success, or complete disaster. It's important that, while playing sniper, to feel the most comfortable and the sniper uses every advantage they can find to be in the optimal headspace. While the differences in weapons does not matter intrinsically, sometimes the decision of which one a sniper picks can have a placebo effect which has a greater impact on that player's performance greater than any subtle differences in weaponry. The exception being sydney sleeper, which acts as a supportive weapon allowing you to debuff enemies rather than kill them. If a player finds their aim to not be consistent, it is much easier to land these supportive hits, allowing a player to triple their impact, even if they have a relatively low skill level and score.
