            The Heavy class is characterized by his large size, and the slowest movement speed in the whole game. Being the last to show up to a mid-fight, and lacking any and all movement abilities, only getting SLOWER as he revs up his minigun, heavy is more suited to holding the line and punishing overconfident players. The heavy's primary weapon has a "spin-up" time in which the massive rotating barrel of his minigun needs to build momentum before it reaches peak fire-rate, and damage.
        </p>

            With his slow movement and huge hitbox, heavy isn't suited to storming the gate. Heavy should be chosen to hold a position your team has already gained, or are desperately holding onto. Heavy is pure brickhouse defense, excelling at literally nothing else. Heavy has poor matchups against most classes due to his slow movement speed and slow setup before his minigun will reach full firing speed. This makes random encounters very difficult, as the heavy will be a sitting duck while his weapon readys itself. Even after the minigun is fully spun up, the weapon does not have hit-or miss burst damage, meaning you have to consistently track enemies to make progress. This makes heavy especially weak to scouts who know how to dodge, and hover above a heavy's head. Other than that, if a heavy's minigun is fully prepared, not much can survive sustained fire from it, with a heavy's large healthpool meaning he will outlast most opponents in head to head fights. This need to consistently track enemies, means classes that can take advantage of distracted foes will pick you off quickly. Keep an eye out for spies, and snipers, as they will often end a heavy out of nowhere.
        </p>

            Avoid getting too confident when playing heavy, his large healthpool makes you feel invincible, but 300 health can melt pretty quick if you're being focused by more than one player. Heavy is often unable to push forward at all without the help of a medic, as his large hitbox absorbs almost every shot thrown near him. Don't try to push into people, hold a position and let people come to you, you'll be surprised by how overconfident people can get.
        </p>

            The heavy's sandvich is the only healing ability in the game outside of the medic's medigun, so be extra vigilant in keeping your teammates, especially your medic, healthy during down time. Otherwise, just try and keep your hitscan aim sharp, and your wits about you. It's important to keep your head on a swivel because as the class with the largest healthpool, you're a common target for spies and snipers, especially as your primary weapon limits your movement and requires constant suppressive fire to get kills.
        </p>

            The main theme of why heavy shouldn't be picked very often is that his speed is so slow. Slow to advance, slow to retreat, slow to attack. There are some weapon choices you can use to mitigate these flaws. Overall for primary weapons, most of the options will just slow a heavy down more. The best options are either stock, which has an extremely large damage output with no additional slowed statistics. The tomislav on the other hand decreases deploy time, and increases accuracy. For secondaries, the sandvich and banana are both items that offer healing for both a heavy player and their teammates. The utility and synergy that these offer is unparralleled in comparison. Your teammates will thank you, and your medics will thank you for equipping the portable health pack. For melee weapons there are a couple options that specifically increase your movement speed, and these are almost a must. The gloves of running urgently and the eviction notice will help a heavy player get to the objective on time. For slower maps where speed is not the primary focus, sometimes its better to focus on being able to tank more damage. The fists of steel reduces damage the player takes by 40%, which is ideal for sticking on the objective, even when that area is recieving a lot of focus fire, but not for dealing damage or getting frags.
