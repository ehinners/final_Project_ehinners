            The Engineer class is characterized by his fourth item slot, granting him the ability to build and construct supportive buildings. His shotgun and pistol offer no extra firepower than a really slow scout, so focus should really be put on constructing buildings, but do not underestimate his weaponry. A gun is still a gun. Due to the time it takes to invest and fully construct his supportive and defensive buildings, your performance will suffer on fast-moving maps, and will excell in game-modes with dedicated defense. In his arsenal of buildable support constructions, the engineer can put up a sentry turret, which starts off strong, evolving to having double miniguns, and finally an added rocketlauncher. Engineer can also construct a dispenser which offers a supportive aura of health and ammo. This can be used to help your teammates recover, or to extend the engineer gameplay as a new source of metal to build or upgrade his contraptions. Engineer's final buildings are the teleporter entrance, and teleporter exit, which can be used to rapidly escort teammates to the front lines. These teleporters can be especially useful on longer maps, where a fast approach isn't as neccessary as much as constant pressure to a fully defended position. This teleportation also helps make slower classes such as pyros and heavies more viable, pushing them directly into the action. 
        </p>

            Lacking all agility and grace, engineer is the second slowest class, only to the heavy. While the heavy has items to expedite his movement, the engineer has none. Avoid playing engineer in fast-paced environments where rapidly changing positioning is key. While engineer will get exponentially more powerful the more there are of them, it's important to note that setting up several sentries and a full base to boot, rooting in so deep will make it all that much more difficult to push out of that position. Similar to pyro, this class is only to be taken in situations where holding an objective is do or die. If you choose to use an upgradable weapon - the gunslinger - some success can be found as an overly aggressive engineer with quick building expendible mini-sentries, mainly effective against teams that have too many aggressive scouts that don't have respect for enemy boundries. Engineer's basic weaponry makes him have mediocre matchups against most classes, but with the aid of his supportive buildings, no class can stand up to a fully built level 3 sentry. Since an engineer will be keeping his head down, with focus on upgrading his buildings, this makes him a prime target for classes that can eliminate distracted opponents, like spies. While playing engineer, stay vigilant to avoid giving spies easy kills.

            The gunplay of engineer is not what he brings to the table, his greatest focus are his supportive and defensive buildings, and as such, poor placement will often be your greatest mistake. Avoid putting your sentry gun too far forward as it is easily seen from far away, and as such spammed out quickly. Avoid putting your sentry gun in areas that don't have any impact on the objective, make sure it offers resistance to anyone trying to capture, or get through a chokepoint. A good sentry spot will also be set back just far enough to give your teammates covering fire if they need to retreat. Avoid an overly aggressive teleporter exit, as it will usually just end up getting your teammates killed, or the exit destroyed. Avoid facing the teleporter exit towards walls, or away from the objective. Make sure that the teleporter points in the direction that they should go, as instantaneous teleportation can be slightly disorienting. Avoid putting your dispenser in places that only benefit you. An engineer is only as good as his team, and if you don't offer them the fullest support in health and ammo that you can provide, you're only doing a disservice to yourself. Avoid putting your dispenser in the open, or too close to your other buildings. A teammate should be in a relatively covered position while healing themself, and away from other targets currently taking fire such as a sentry gun that will almost certainly be spammed at.

            Improving at engineer usually comes down to timing and map knowledge. It doesn't take quick reflexes or good prediction to be a good and supportive engineer, just focus on being efficient in when you set up your buildings, and when to rotate position. When the match starts, you only have a small time frame to set up all your buildings before the enemy storms the gate. Make sure you know where you're going to put your buildings, in what order, and where to refill your metal. Make sure you have your pre-round routine down so your buildings will be ready before the fight starts. Also keep in mind that common sentry spots have not changed over the course of time, and  most players will know where to expect your buildings to be. You'll find great success in looking for creative and fresh spots to put your buildings, just keep in mind the common pitfalls of what makes a spot poor and what the role of each building is relative to where it needs to be positioned.

            Unlike other classes, engineer's melee weapons are used for more than smacking people around, and each wrench is integrally tied to his active abilities. Almost every wrench excells in a different area, and care should be taken when choosing which one to equip. The Eureka effect excells in quickly transversing the map, and this utility is used to the greatest extent at the beginning of a round when you're setting up your buildings for the very first time. Not only does building each part of your teleporter cost less while the eurekea effect is equipped, but it costs less to upgrade, even if you have switched away from the wrench. You can do some cool, and very time efficient things by using the eureka effect's teleport to quickly gain access to spawn, and all the free metal it provides, just keep in mind that it loses its practibility very quickly while you're being shot at. Again, the next wrench excells in quickly setting up buildings before the round begins. While you can use the eureka effect to quickly jump around the map to get all your buildings built, the jag lets you quickly upgrade them to the highest tier. Generally, as both these "set up" wrenches have downsides that make them less flexible, for the duration of the main match, the stock wrench is flexible enough in all regards to be the best option. If you find yourself playing a faster paced game mode that includes no pre-round timer, such as king of the hill or capture point, you will almost exclusively need to use the gunslinger. Not only does this item give you the extra health boost to help you survive a team fight, but the quick building disposable mini sentries the gunslinger gives you access to are the counter point to why the engineer's slowness and need for time invesment holds him back in almost every game mode. Other notable weapons include the wrangler, which effectively triples your sentry's health, doubles its damage output, and quadruples its range. It's a no-brainer. Unless you're having difficulty constructing your sentries, this will be greatly destructive. Similarly, the rescue ranger offers unique utility in letting you heal your sentry at range and moving it at range, this item will extend the life of your sentry gun significantly, but unlike the wrangler, this item finds little utility paired with the gunslinger. As your usefulness is tied to your building placement, your other primary weapon choices have very little impact, so if you're focusing on a more combat focused gunslinger style, feel free to use any of engineer's 4 shotguns, they'll all serve you well.
