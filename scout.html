            The Scout class is characterized by his small frame, having the fastest movement speed, and being able to maneuver mid-air with a secondary jump. While his scattergun lacks range, at point blank he
        will take out most other classes in two clean shots. His passive ability makes him ideal for capturing points and pushing the cart, as he counts as two players with his great speed.

            With his incredible speed and agility, scout can be a powerful force in almost any situation. Scout can also be used to rush in for a surprise play to quickly secure an objective before the enemy can secure defenses around it. It's pretty important that your team have one or two scouts at all times, but with all classes, it's just as important to not have too many. Note that scout's survivability comes from the same place as his power - speed and agility. Against targets that don't have trouble aiming, like sentry guns, or in environments that are hard to maneuver in, like chokepoints, scout will struggle to push through. In these situations, it's often better to let a stronger class with more health push through, and support them. Scouts have favorable matchups against all classes if they can get the first shot in, but if not, they will suffer against soldiers. Demoman's lack of hitscan weaponry means a scout can win fights against them easily, and scouts can pick off classes without close-range fighting capability with little to no effort, such as medics or snipers. A scout can sometimes take on a heavy one on one, as the heavy needs time to prepare his minigun and get it up to full speed, but if the heavy is already firing somewhere else, it's not advised to take fights against them.

            There are two common mistakes scout players make. While your agility and speed often grants you great survivability, you are not immune to small amounts of chip damage as you make your approach. Due to the limited range of your weapons, care should be taken to not take obvious routes and take fights while hurt. This same effective range that makes your scattergun more powerful also makes you vulnerable to splash damage. At longer ranges, you might be able to dodge rockets quite effectively, but you will often lose fights against soldiers. When fighting them, do so passively, do not over-commit, and try to not get too close.

            Scout's core gameplay loop comes down to a simple premise, jump and shoot, but to do so better than everyone else, there are key things to focus on to improve your gameplay.
            1. Scout's speed and agility allows you to pick your fights. Size other players up, focus on threat analysis, and only engage in a fight you think you can win. Since you can out-run everyone else, don't be afraid to simply turn tail. 
            2. Often times players will abuse scout's speed to get to the front lines before everyone else. It will be tempting to push your speed further, and take the fight straight to the enemy, but the best scout players hold restraint. A more effective strategy rather than trying to race from end to end of the map, is to use your speed to race side to side. In the midst of a fight, you can speed to and fro from each edge of the brawl without crossing over into enemy territory. Use this to support your teammates and turn your friend's 1 v 1s into 2 v 1s. Don't be afraid to support.
            3. Due to scout's speed, often times you will find yourself quite far away from your medic. Take the time to learn all the healthpack locations on each map. Make mental notes of where they are, and when they might respawn. Catching a health pack at the right time is the difference between life and death. 
            4. When a soldier tries to rocket jump into a fight, this is a powerful move that not many players can deal with. Learning to airshot takes lots of practice and great aim. Focus on lessening this burden from your soldiers and demos by taking the high ground when you can. Due to your speed, you will often find yourself with the advantage of being able to secure a position before anyone else has shown up. Take care to take the high ground to deny rocket jumpers. Not only will you deny a rocket jump, but being above a soldier means they will have a much harder time hitting you with splash damage. Learn where boxes and edges are on the map that you can jump on to gain that height advantage, and practice jumping from one to the other so that in fights you can focus more on your aim, rather than where you're moving. Even the smallest obstacle you can stand on gives you great positional advantage, so keep an eye out for opportunities to capatalize on creative movement.
        </p>

            Scout's fancy item unlocks might be tempting, but no item offers any sort of significant damage bonus greater than your default weapons. Because of this, it is more beneficial to focus on not how much damage you can deal per shot, but how many shots you can fire before having to reload. Keeping this in mind, all of scout's primary weapons have less ammo capacity than his default scattergun, and all of his secondary weapons either are one time use items, or have smaller magazines than the default pistol. I know it's not glamorous to use the default items, but they truly are the best. <br>
            Ignoring damage for a second, it's important to keep in mind that you will not be constantly shooting the entire time you play. In the downtime, it is important to secure good positioning. There are three items that help you do this, but make sure to only equip one. The Bonk! Atomic Punch will allow you to push through areas where your agility will fail you, such as chokepoints, or under fire from sentry guns. This item is highly scenario specific, so make sure to unequip it when you have more freedom to move around. Sometimes, there will be great spots to gain height advantage, but they're just out of your reach. Sometimes, you play against someone so familiar with the game, they can predict your movement EVEN with your great speed and agility. In those circumstances, it's beneficial to use an item that boosts your number of jumps, or the height of your jump. For this, the winger and atomizer are unparralleled. If you need to get somewhere before the shooting starts, these will help you get there. <br>
            The final aspect to keep in mind of choosing weapons is how you interact with your team. While the default scattergun and pistol have the best damage output, you're still free to switch up your melee slot. The best option for this is the boston basher. Why? That's a little complicated. On paper, the ability to deal damage to yourself if you miss a swing seems awful, usesless even, but theres a highly practical use for this. <a HREF= "medic.html">Medics</a>.
