# final_Project_ehinners
A fully featured intro website for pc gamers to get into competitive Team Fortress 2


This project has 13 individual html pages, all relevant to the popular 2007 free to play game "Team Fortress 2", (aka TF2)

In the game there are 9 classes, each one given their own individual page. A home page, general "tips" page, and contact page are included.
This was my final project for intro to web dev, and in addition, one more page has been included to make this my final project for
javascript.

The final added page is an "uber tracker", which is a tool/calculator useful for players at a high level who play TF2.

A summary of what an "uber tracker" does, and what features it has:

UBER
 - In the game, each team may or may not have a medic
 - the medic has a powerful ability to make his teammates totally invulnerable for a brief period by activating his "ubercharge"
 - the medic, as he heals teammates, slowly builds this charge from 0%, up to 100%, and only at 100% can he deploy the charge
 
TRACKER

 - It is advantageous for one team to attack the other while one has a fully charged "uber" and the enemy does not
 - It can be predicted when a medic will have an uber, because it takes at minimum 40 seconds to reach 100% from 0%.
 - The difference of between one medic's percent charge and another medic's charge is referred to as "advantage"
 
FEATURES

 - The tracker allows for a player to have a rough estimate of when an enemy team will have an ubercharge compared to their own medic's
 charge. 
 - The tracker has a representation of the game clock, so players can run mock examples to come up with mental timestamps of when they 
 should look out for certain things.
 - The tracker has an easy to read interface of overall advantage.
 - When an uber is used, or a medic RESPAWNS, the reset button can be clicked to instantly zero out a charge.
 - A kritz light is implemented as a reminder to players that while it might appear they have an advantage, the "kritzkrieg medigun" item
 is a tricky threat that has the potential to surprise a team with a premature ubercharge.
