            The Spy class is characterized by his additional weapons, and multiple abilities. While the spy only has two active weapons, in the form of a knife and a revolver, all of his extra items and abilities help him close the gap and set up situations in which he can make his knife most useful. Stabbing an enemy in the back will result in a massive damage instant-kill, dealing damage equal to three times that player's current health. To get close enough for the stab, the spy can turn invisble, fake his death, and change his appearance to be a perfect facade of his enemies, allowing him to sneak upon the ranks of the enemy undetected. This makes him ideal for taking out opponents in heavily fortified positions, or players with so much health that they may not be killed without extended cooperation. Spy also excells in punishing players for being distracted, allowing him to sabotage engineer buildings with his sapper if the engineer isn't paying attention, and quickly end players who are unaware of their surroundings.

            Spy's ability to disguise and cloak means he can slip into even the most heavily fortified bases, so he is an ideal choice when the game has crawled to a stalemate, or if the objective is left unattended behind a wall of overzealous and overextended defensive players. Spy's effectiveness is at its peak if his attack comes unseen, or unpredicted. If a spy has made too many attempts, too many approaches, or has made his presence too known, enemy players will start taking precautions to avoid being stabbed, and this will severely hamper his ability to succeed. Playing spy is a bad choice if the spy has been present for most of the game, or if there is more than one spy. Playing spy is mostly about seizing opportunities, and if none are presenting themselves, it's probably better to choose a different class. Spy offers the same issue that sniper does, in that he needs time and space to operate and set up an elimination. This time spent unseen results in less visible bodies in the middle of firefights, with a logical conclusion that non-spy players will be taking greater focus fire. Spy will struggle against faster paced classes. Against rosters of scouts, rocket jumping/sticky jumping soldiers and demos, spy will find himself struggling to get any kills outside of a stalemate situation. Spy is best used to end stalemates, or break defenses, but if neither of those conditions exist, it is better to focus on a more combat effective class. Slower classes, or classes that are easily distracted, such as heavies, snipers, or engineers should be easy pickings for a spy.

        <p id="big" >
            The biggest mistake spy players make is being too obvious, or relying too heavily on a disguise. At this point, the game is so old that most players are already suspicious of most other players, and will regularly check most teammates they see. Staying visible for too long, even if disguised, will often blow a spy's cover, especially if that spy was following, or walking directly behind someone staring at an enemy's back. It can also be a mistake to disguise as scout, since scouts can move at such a higher speed, enemy players will be VERY suspicious of a scout moving slowly. It is also a very bad decision to disguise as the same class too often, as once a cover is blown once, players will be on the lookout for spy's disguised as that same player. Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, shame on you.
        </p>

        <p id="big" >
            The best thing to practice when playing as spy, is the immediate approach right before the stab. It's best to time your stab that you are visible for the smallest amount of time before you attack. Best times to strike, are dropping down onto someone, or timing an approach to hide behind a corner and pop out right before it is predicted that an enemy player will walk through. The best spies can often look at a player as they approach (usually studying enemies while the spy is cloaked) and predict the path of movement that the opposing player will take. Get comfortable with knowing how fast certain classes move, and time an approach by appearing at the same exact time the target does, giving them little or no time to react. Its also good practice to try and use surrounding sounds to mask an approach. When a spy decloaks, it makes an audible sound, for both the spy player and other players around them. If following too closely to a target, and nothing else is around, that player might hear a decloak and turn around to confront the spy player.
